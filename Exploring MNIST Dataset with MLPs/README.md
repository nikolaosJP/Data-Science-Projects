The work of a great painter is often valued for its unique style, typically reflected in the artist's choice of color and brush strokes. Today, deep learning allows us to imitate the paintings of reputable artists such as Vincent van Gogh and Salvador Dalí with generative adversarial networks (GANs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) through a process referred to as neural style transferring.

Neural Style Transfer (NST) refers to a class of software algorithms that manipulate digital images, or videos, in order to adopt the appearance or visual style of another image. NST algorithms are characterized by their use of deep neural networks for the sake of image transformation. Common uses for NST are the creation of artificial artwork from photographs, for example by transferring the appearance of famous paintings to user-supplied photographs. Several notable mobile apps use NST techniques for this purpose, including DeepArt and Prisma. This method has been used by artists and designers around the globe to develop new artwork based on existent style(s).

This body of work represents a small chunk of code which anyone can use to transform an image into a piece of art (no painting skills required!).
