# Linear Regression & Statistics Learning Platform

An interactive web application designed to help students, researchers, and practitioners learn and visualize core statistical ideas from first principles. The platform now offers two categories:

- **Regression** – explore Ordinary Least Squares, Gradient Descent, and manual derivations with interactive plots.
- **Statistics** – compute correlation, covariance, Welch's t-test, and one-way ANOVA from custom numeric inputs.

This makes abstract statistical concepts easier to understand by coupling equations with interactive visualizations and concise numerical summaries.


## Setup

Clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the application locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/app.py
```
