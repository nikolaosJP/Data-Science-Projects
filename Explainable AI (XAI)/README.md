# Linear Regression & Statistics Learning Platform

An interactive web application designed to help students, researchers, and practitioners learn and visualize core statistical ideas from first principles. The platform now offers two categories:

- **Regression** – explore Ordinary Least Squares, Gradient Descent, and manual derivations with interactive plots.
- **Statistics** – navigate dedicated tabs for correlation/covariance, Welch's t-test, and one-way ANOVA complete with tailored visualizations, intermediate calculations, and rendered formulas. Add and manipulate samples directly on each canvas by clicking (drag to adjust, right-click to delete) instead of entering raw numbers manually.
