# Linear Regression Learning Platform

An interactive web application designed to help students, researchers, and practitioners learn and visualize how linear regression works from first principles. The platform demonstrates:

- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
- Gradient Descent (GD)
- Sum of Squares decomposition (TSS, ESS, RSS)

This makes abstract statistical concepts easier to understand by coupling equations with interactive visualizations.


## Setup

Clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the application locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/app.py
