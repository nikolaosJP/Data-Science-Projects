# Machine / Deep Learning with Python

This repository contains numerous jupyter notebooks covering a wide range of machine learning & deep learning algorithms (e.g., convolutional and recurrent networks, model optimization techniques, etc.). The supporting files necessary to work through a given project from start to finish are contained within each respective project folder.

In most cases, the notebooks are meant to be minimal and easily reusable and extendable. You are free to use them for educational and research purposes.
