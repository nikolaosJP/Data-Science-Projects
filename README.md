# Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my digital workshop! This is where I build things that range from "teaching machines to see" to "making my resume not look like everyone else's." Each project comes with documentation that hopefully makes more sense than IKEA instructions.

## What's Inside

<h3 style="margin-bottom:0;">Machine Learning & AI</h3>
<h6 style="margin-top:2px; font-style:italic;">
Teaching computers to do cool stuff (and occasionally debugging why they do weird stuff)
</h6>

**Neural Networks**  
[MNIST Digit Classification](https://github.com/nikolaosJP/Projects/tree/main/Exploring-MNIST-Dataset-with-MLPs): Built a multilayer perceptron that can read handwritten digits better than most doctors.

**Computer Vision**  
[Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/nikolaosJP/Projects/tree/main/MVTec-Anomaly-Detection): Transfer learning with VGG16 to spot defects in manufacturing. Because even machines need quality control.  
[Style Transfer](https://github.com/nikolaosJP/Projects/tree/main/Introduction-to-style-transferring): Turn your photos into Van Gogh paintings. Your Instagram will never be the same.

**Explainability**  
[Explainable AI Platform](https://github.com/nikolaosJP/Projects/tree/main/Explainable-AI-XAI): An interactive app that shows what's actually happening under the hood of ML models. No more black boxes!

**Recommendation Systems**  
[Movie Recommender](https://github.com/nikolaosJP/Projects/tree/main/Recommendation-Systems): Collaborative filtering with matrix factorization and neural networks on MovieLens data. Yes, it's better than Netflix's "Because you watched..." suggestions.


<h3 style="margin-bottom:0;">Finance & Trading</h3>
<h6 style="margin-top:2px; font-style:italic;">
Where math meets money (responsibly, of course)
</h6>

[Energy Market Forecasting](https://github.com/nikolaosJP/Projects/tree/main/Energy-Market-Prediction): Day-ahead energy price predictions using XGBoost and Optuna. Achieved €1.38M PNL in backtesting. Disclaimer: Past performance doesn't guarantee future results, but it does make cool visualizations.
[Portfolio Tracker](https://github.com/nikolaosJP/Projects/tree/main/Portfolio-Tracker): Automated analytics for Interactive Brokers accounts. Track performance, get rebalancing recommendations, and see pretty charts. Because spreadsheets are so 2010.
[Rent vs Buy Simulator](https://github.com/nikolaosJP/Projects/tree/main/Rent-vs-Buy-Simulator): Interactive calculator comparing long-term financial outcomes of renting versus buying property. Includes mortgage analysis, tax deductions, and opportunity cost calculations with visual projections.


<h3 style="margin-bottom:0;">Productivity Tools</h3>
<h6 style="margin-top:2px; font-style:italic;">
Automating the boring stuff so I can focus on the interesting stuff
</h6>

[AI Resume Tailor](https://github.com/nikolaosJP/Projects/tree/main/Resume-Tailor): Uses Google's Gemini API to customize your LaTeX resume for each job application. Because manually tweaking resumes is nobody's idea of fun.  
[Cost of Living Scraper](https://github.com/nikolaosJP/Projects/tree/main/Cost-of-Living-Scraper): Scrapes Numbeo for cost-of-living data across countries and cities. Outputs clean Parquet files for analysis. Great for digital nomads and data nerds.  
[Goal Tracker](https://github.com/nikolaosJP/Projects/tree/main/Goal-Tracker): A lightweight goal management app for tracking daily, weekly, monthly, and annual objectives. React frontend + Python backend, no build step required. (Work in progress)


<h3 style="margin-bottom:0;">Learning Journey</h3>
<h6 style="margin-top:2px; font-style:italic;">
Proof that I actually read those textbooks
</h6>

[Textbook Solutions](https://github.com/nikolaosJP/Projects/tree/main/Textbook-Exercises): Worked solutions from "Applied Predictive Modeling" and "Introduction to Statistical Learning." Because the best way to learn is by doing (and then documenting it).


**Note:** All projects are here for educational and research purposes. Feel free to explore, fork, and improve! Found a bug? That's a feature in disguise. Just kidding—submit an issue.
