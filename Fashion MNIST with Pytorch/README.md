In a similar fashion to the MNIST database (pun intended), Fashion-MNIST is a collection of monochrome images, only this time consisting exclusively of basic clothing items such as T-shirts, dresses, etc. It consists of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples, each of which is a 28x28 grayscale image.

The goal of this project
In this IPython notebook we will use PyTorch, a deep learning library to build a multilayer perceptron (MLP) which will allow us to accurately classify the hand written digits contained within the MNIST dataset. This work was inspired by Xiao et al. (2017) and Udacity's "Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch".
