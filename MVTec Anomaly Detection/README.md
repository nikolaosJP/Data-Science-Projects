MVTec AD is an open access dataset used for training anomaly detection ML algorithms. It contains over 5.000 high-res images divided into 15 different objects, some of which are characterised by a morphological anomaly. These anomalies are manifested in a myriad of forms such as scratches, dents, or other structural irregularities.

In this IPython notebook we will use Transfer Learning, a popular approach in deep learning, to firstly distinguish objects in pristine condition from those with anomalies and secondly to detect the exact location of any potential physical defects. Transfer Learning, in case you are unfamiliar with the concept, is a technique where...[to be continued]
